NAME
    GD::Latin2 - ISO-8859-2 support for GD module

DESCRIPTION
    This is a patch that replaces standard ASCII-only font in libgd, used by
    GD module, by those with full 256 char Latin2 support. In order to put
    new fonts into the library, the source has to be changed and the library
    recompiled. That's why you need to have untarred GD library ready before
    aplying this patch.
